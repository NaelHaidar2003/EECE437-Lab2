// LSP states that derived classes should be able to replace their base class without altering the correctness of the program.
// The CheckingAccount class extends BankAccount but does not remove or restrict functionalityâ€”it only adds a withdrawal fee.
// The overridden Deposit method behaves identically to the base class, ensuring seamless substitution.
